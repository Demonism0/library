# library
A simple Library app with the option to add new books, and input the book's
title, author, number of pages and read status.
Click on 'New Book' to open a dialog form, to add a new book.
Books can be deleted with the 'Delete' button, and read status can be changed
using the 'Read' or 'Unread' button.
